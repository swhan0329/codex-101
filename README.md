## 📖 About

**Codex 101** is a comprehensive guide to OpenAI's coding agent **Codex**, organized for both first-time users and advanced practitioners.

Based on the [official OpenAI documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/) and OpenAI Docs MCP lookups, the guide is **manually reviewed and verified** before publication.

### Quick Paths By Audience

- **First-time users**: Start with sections **04-06** (setup, sign-in, first run), then **10** (approval/sandbox basics), and **14** (OpenAI Docs MCP).
- **Professional users**: Start with sections **12-14** (AGENTS.md, config.toml, MCP), then **15-17** (session strategy, automation, prompting contracts).

### Daily MCP Verification Snapshot (2026-03-28)

- Re-checking `codex/models` shows the same four recommended lanes: `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, and `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. The alternative-model list is also broader than a casual summary would suggest: `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5-codex-mini`, and `gpt-5` still appear as supported alternatives. The current page also explicitly says the coding capabilities of `gpt-5.3-codex` now power GPT-5.4.
- The `Introducing GPT-5.4` framing is broader than “better coding”: GPT-5.4 is positioned as the flagship professional model combining GPT-5.3-Codex-level coding with stronger reasoning, tool use, native computer use, stronger tool search, and up to 1M tokens of context.
- Pricing and access are more specific than before. Quickstart and Pricing currently show limited-time Free and Go access, plus a 2x rate-limit promotion on paid plans. The pricing page also exposes model-specific five-hour local/cloud/code-review ranges and average credit costs. In practice, `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` remain the main local-message choices, while cloud tasks and GitHub code reviews are still centered on `gpt-5.3-codex`.
- Quickstart, IDE, and Windows setup are clearer about surfaces: the app remains the beginner-friendly path, macOS app setup is Apple Silicon-first, Linux is still “get notified,” and the IDE story explicitly covers VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and JetBrains with ChatGPT/API-key/JetBrains-AI sign-in options.
- Windows guidance is more operationally detailed than older revisions: the app path is the default recommendation, installation is documented through Microsoft Store and `winget`, native Windows sandboxing distinguishes `elevated` vs `unelevated`, the private desktop is the default, and WSL remains the preferred fallback for IDE agent work.
- The `Introducing the Codex app` launch post now matters to this guide too. It foregrounds the app as a command center for agents with worktrees, skills, Automations, and `/personality`, so the top of this guide now surfaces those workflows much earlier.
- `config.toml` drift remains one of the highest-risk areas. The current reference emphasizes `review_model`, top-level `web_search`, `tools.web_search`, `service_tier`, `personality`, `default_permissions`, JSON schema validation, `windows.sandbox`, `windows.sandbox_private_desktop`, and `model_instructions_file`.
- Customization guidance also has a clearer distribution layer: skills are the authoring format for repeatable workflows, while plugins are the installable bundle that can package skills, optional app integrations, and MCP config together for team rollout. `Codex for Open Source` and `Building an AI-Native Engineering Team` remain useful official companion pages for maintainers and team adoption.

### Audience Quick Use

- **First-time users (10 minutes)**: install/sign in (`04-06`) → keep default sandbox/approval (`10`) → run one small edit task with Git checkpoint.
- **Professional users (team rollout)**: lock AGENTS.md + `.codex/config.toml` (`12-14`) → standardize `codex exec`/review flow (`15-16`) → adopt section `17` prompt contract as team baseline.
