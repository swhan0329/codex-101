## About

**Codex 101** is a practical, bilingual guide for people learning or rolling out OpenAI Codex. It covers the main Codex surfaces, setup decisions, safety controls, configuration, MCP, workflow automation, and prompt patterns.

The guide is written from the official OpenAI Codex documentation first, then manually reviewed before publishing. Because Codex changes quickly, treat the live guide as a learning companion and always confirm critical model, pricing, security, and availability details in the [official docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/).

## Start Here

- **First-time users**: read sections `04-06` for setup and first run, then `10` for sandbox/approval basics, and `14` for OpenAI Docs MCP.
- **Professional users**: read sections `12-14` for `AGENTS.md`, `config.toml`, and MCP, then `15-17` for sessions, automation, and prompt contracts.
- **Example-driven readers**: open the live site and the use-case gallery to start from real workflows instead of feature lists.

## July 15, 2026 Refresh Notes

- Rechecked `developers.openai.com/codex/models` first. Recommended Codex models remain the GPT-5.6 family: `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`; `gpt-5.5` remains previous-generation, and `gpt-5.2` / `gpt-5.3-codex` remain deprecated for ChatGPT-authenticated Codex.
- Tightened the Max/Ultra note from the current model and subagents docs: Max gives one selected model more reasoning time for a single hard task, while Ultra uses subagents for divisible work and may require enabling **Ultra in model picker slider** under Settings > Configuration.
- Rechecked pricing, Speed/Fast mode, remote connections, app/features, app/automations, config, MCP, hooks, plugins, skills, Sites, OpenAI API latest-model/changelog, and current Platform/API surfaces. No model-order, pricing, remote-control, Windows activation, Sites, credential, permission, or feature-flag reversal was found.
- Added the July 13/14 Codex changelog notes: iOS 1.2026.185 adds inline visualizations for charts and other visual artifacts plus mobile task-flow fixes, and CLI 0.144.2 restored the previous Guardian auto-review policy after rolling back a prompting regression. CLI 0.144.3/0.144.4 are version-only releases.
- Reflected OpenAI API GPT-5.6 guidance separately from Codex product guidance: `gpt-5.6` routes to `gpt-5.6-sol`; GPT-5.6 adds Programmatic Tool Calling, Multi-agent beta, explicit prompt caching, persisted reasoning, max reasoning effort, Pro mode, and original/auto image detail preservation. Codex `Max` and `Ultra` are documented as product power settings, not API mode names.
- Re-audited the official use-case catalog: official individual pages 99, local cards 99, `promptEn` gaps 0, `promptKo` gaps 0, official Starter prompt mismatches 0, line/token structure regressions 0. The `daily-work-brief` official slug still maps to the preserved local `proactive-teammate` ID.
- No newly corroborated practitioner tip needed promotion into the public guide today, so Section 20's person-linked cards stay tied to existing official evidence and source links.

## June 12, 2026 Refresh Notes

- Reflected the June 11 Codex app 26.609 release: rate-limit reset banking, Developer mode for Browser/CDP work, `/init` in the app composer, expanded Enterprise Computer Use, and Windows Computer Use per-app access controls.
- Rechecked pricing, quickstart, config/profile, app settings/features, remote connections, Sites, Bedrock, MCP, hooks, plugins, and skills through the fresh Codex manual. No model-order, remote-control, or Sites setup reversal was needed, but Quickstart now clearly foregrounds the standalone installers.
- Audited all 99 official Codex use cases after excluding collection pages. The catalog count, local/official IDs, `promptEn`, `promptKo`, and multiline Korean prompt shape are clean.
- Rechecked OpenAI launch/customer-story surfaces. The June 11 Ona acquisition announcement is captured only as pre-closing enterprise execution direction, not as an enabled feature, model, plan, platform, preview/GA, or feature-flag change.
- Person-linked practitioner tips stay separate from product documentation. The public guide points readers to original posts or official corroborating docs, and only verified, reader-useful guidance is promoted.
